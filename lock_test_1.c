/*
This test inits a mutex lock and starts two threads.
Both threads start by taking on the lock, count un to half-way, releases the lock, then continues counting until finish
You shuold see that at the start, one thread will take the lock first, and the second thread will immediately get blocked
You should initially only see print statements from the thread that first took the lock.
After the first thread relesaes the lock, the second thread should now be scheduled normally
Both threads also change a shared global variable "changeme" so you can observe the exclusivity property
